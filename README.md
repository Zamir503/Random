## Usage

Once the game is running, you will see a prompt asking you to guess a number between 1 and 100. Type your guess and press Enter. The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct. You have five attempts to guess the number correctly.

### Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to the Random Number Guessing Game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100:

Your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Your guess: 37
Correct! You've guessed the number!
```

## Gameplay

The game begins by generating a random number between 1 and 100. You have five attempts to guess this number. After each guess, the game provides feedback:

- **Too High**: Your guess is higher than the generated number.
- **Too Low**: Your guess is lower than the generated number.
- **Correct**: You've guessed the number!

The game ends when you either guess the number correctly or run out of attempts. If you fail to guess correctly, the game reveals the number, and you can choose to play again.
